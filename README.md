After using the picgo plugin to upload images to the remote server, replace the local image paths in the notebook with the remote URLs.

> Please note that the plugin does not actually upload images. It only reads the information stored by the picgo plugin ([siyuan-plugin-picgo](https://github.com/terwer/siyuan-plugin-picgo) v1.5.1) and replaces the image paths in the document.

> It is recommended to perform the replacement on a backup document to ensure no data loss, as extensive testing has not been conducted.
